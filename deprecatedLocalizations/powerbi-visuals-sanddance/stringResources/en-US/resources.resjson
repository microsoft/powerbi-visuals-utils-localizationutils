    "SandDance_Long_Description": "SandDance is the Microsoft Research data visualization project, spearheaded by Steven M. Drucker and Roland Fernandez, that experiments with new genres of visualization and represents an innovation in user interactions. With SandDance, every data element is always represented on the screen, and animated transitions are used between views to help people explore, understand, and communicate insights in their data.\nThe SandDance custom visual puts this innovation from Microsoft Research into the hands of users through the open, extensible visualization framework of Power BI that can leverage rich connectivity, modeling, and interactive reporting.\nIf you need a visualization that lets you 'see the forest for the trees', or in other words shows the big picture by observing the more granular details, then SandDance is for you. The focus of SandDance is on tasks where data is not pre-aggregated (that is, many individual records), and can be rearranged in groups on the screen to create meaning.\nOnce you have created a SandDance chart you can change the View, and there are some interesting types available, including 3D. You can also Sum by any column in the dataset. While this may look like a summary chart, it is actually created with many rectangles. This can be seen more clearly if we color the rectangles differently. In the Color by options you can select the color palette. You can use Facet by to view the same visualization broken up by different ranges of a particular attribute.\nYou can change the behavior of dragging the cursor from the default of selecting shapes to zoom or 3D rotate using the navigation panel button in the menu bar of SandDance. And that's just the beginning of how you can customize SandDance -- there are many other functionalities that you can enable using the settings button.\nFor more detailed help, check out http://www.sanddance.ms"
